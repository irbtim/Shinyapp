# Shinyapp
Shiny app for flat price
This repository has the ui.R and server.R files as part of the Developing Data Products Course Project.
In the first part we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
Reproducible Pitch Presentation is he second part of the assignment which should be hosted on either github or Rpubs.
My choice was to create the shiny application for price dependence of flats in Moscow.

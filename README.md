# Shinyapp
Shiny app for flat price
This repository has the ui.R and server.R files as part of the Developing Data Products Course Project.
In part first we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
Reproducible Pitch Presentation is he second part of assignment which can be hosted on either github or Rpubs.
My choice was create shiny application for price dependence of flats in Moscow.
